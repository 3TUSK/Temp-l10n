If you want to put a language file here:

1. Check if there is already a folder with the name of mod you are translating, or there is already another repo for your translation file

2. If you answer yes for 1., upload the file with correct name to proper folder.

3. If you answer no for 1., set up a new folder with the name of mod you are localzing and upload your file into this new     folder. Using "_" instead of " " in name is recommended.

4. Upload en_US.lang as the reference is recommended.

5. Once a language file gets its appropiate place and get merged, file should be deleted from this repo, unless it's backup
