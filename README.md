# Temp L10n

#### Introduction
This is the main repository of "Temp. L10n" (formally known as Temp_LocalizationFile, TemporaryLocalization), a Minecraft resourcepack with purpose to provide the Simplified Chinese (简体中文, ISO 639-1: zh-CN) translation for Minecraft mods which *haven't* officially support localization yet.  
Credits to [this](https://github.com/Adaptivity/LocalizationsForMCFMods) for the idea of assembling a resourcepack.
