# Temp_LocalizationFile

#### Introduction
This is just a repository where can put some localization files, especially for the language files 

1.that no more appropriate place for them.

2.that needs edited frequently

Technically this repository is only for Minecraft mods. 

Usage may change, depending on future.

#### Usage
If you want to put a language file here:

1. Check if there is already a folder with the name of mod you are translating, or there is already another repo for your translation file

2. If you answer yes for 1., upload the file with correct name to proper folder.

3. If you answer no for 1., set up a new folder with the name of mod you are localizing and upload your file into this new folder. Using "_" instead of " " in name is recommended.

4. Upload `en_US.lang` as the reference is recommended.

5. Once a language file gets its appropriate place and get merged, file should be deleted from this repo, unless it's backup

#### Contributing Requirement
At the same time, here provides support of discussing and editing localization file. If you need to do so, remember:

    1.Accurate, it is NECESSARY
    
    2.Readable, or in another word, "understandable"
    
    3.Beautiful, if possible

#### About permission
I keep the right to remove file to response original author's request.

If there's no more problem, all language file should inherit licence from which the file(s) originally belongs to.

If there is no information about license, all language file without license should be under CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0.
