# Temp-l10n

#### Introduction
Here is the main repository of "Temp-l10n", formally known as "Temp_LocalizationFile" and "TemporaryLocalization", a Minecraft resourcepack with purpose to provide the Simplified Chinese (简体中文, ISO 639 `zh_CN`) translation for Minecraft mods which *haven't* officially support localization yet.  
Credits to [this](https://github.com/Adaptivity/LocalizationsForMCFMods) for the idea of assembling a resourcepack.
