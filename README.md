# Temp_LocalizationFile
This is just a repository where can put some localization files,
especially for the language files that no more appropriate place for them.
Technically this repository is only for Minecraft mods. 
Usage may change, depending on future.

# Usage
If you want to put a language file here:

    1.check if there is already a folder with the name of mod you are loaclizing, or there is already another repo for your translation file

    2.if you answer yes for 1., upload the file with correct name to proper folder.

    3.if you answer no for 1., set up a new folder with the name of mod you are localzing and upload your file into this new     folder. Using "_" instead of " " is recommended.

    4.Upload en_US.lang as the reference is recommended.

At the same time, here provides support of discussing and editing localization file. If you need to do so, remember:

    1.Accurate, it is NECESSARY
    
    2.Readable, or in another word, "understandable"
    
    3.Beautiful, if possible

# About permission
I keep the permission to remove file to responce original author's request.
If no more other porblem, all language file should use the license that the mod uses, whcich the language file belongs to.
