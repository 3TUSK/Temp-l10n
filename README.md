# Temp_LocalizationFile

#### Introduction
Here is the main repository of "Temporary Localization", a Minecraft resourcepack with purpose to provide the Simplified Chinese (zh-CN, 简体中文) translation for Minecraft mods which *haven't* officially support localization yet.  
Credits to [this](https://github.com/Adaptivity/LocalizationsForMCFMods) for the idea of assembling a resourcepack.
