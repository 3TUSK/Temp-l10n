# Temp_LocalizationFile

#### Introduction
This is just a repository where can put some localization files, especially for the language files 

1. that no more appropriate place for them.

2. that needs edited frequently

Technically this repository is only for Minecraft mods. 

Usage may change, depending on future.

#### Usage
If you want to put a language file here:

1. Check if there is already a folder with the name of mod you are translating, or there is already another repo for your translation file

2. If you answer yes for 1., upload the file with correct name to proper folder.

3. If you answer no for 1., set up a new folder with the name of mod you are localizing and upload your file into this new folder. Using "_" instead of " " in name is recommended.

4. Upload `en_US.lang` as the reference is recommended.

5. Once a language file gets its appropriate place and get merged, file should be deleted from this repo, unless it's backup

#### Contributing Requirement
At the same time, here provides support of discussing and editing localization file. If you need to do so, remember:

    1.Accurate, it is NECESSARY
    
    2.Readable, or in another word, "understandable"
    
    3.Beautiful, if possible

#### About permission
I keep the right to remove file to response original author's request.

If there's no more problem, all language files should inherit licence from which the file(s) originally belongs to.

If there is no information about license, all languages file without license should be under CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0.

Keep in mind: 

1. since I choose CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0, if someone want to show who have offered assistance in the localization file, all contributors' name should be clearly stated in the form of notes (i.e. states like this: ````###Appreciate A, B, C for their generous contribution````) at the head of lang file for ONLY once.

2. Try cleaning files regularly. On the one hand we want the latest lang files, on the other hand some files may be able to find a proper repository to stay and it's better to send them to their home.

If you still have question please do not be hesitate to open a new issue or email the repo owner directly.
