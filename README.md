This is just a repository where can put some localization files,
especially for the language files that no more appropriate place for them.
Technically this repository is only for Minecraft mods. 
Usage may change, depending on future.

# Usage
If you want to put a language file here:

    1.check if there is already a folder with the name of mod you are loaclizing, or there is already another repo for your translation file

    2.if you answer yes for 1., upload the file with correct name to proper folder.

    3.if you answer no for 1., set up a new folder with the name of mod you are localzing and upload your file into this new     folder. Using "_" instead of " " is recommended.

    4.Upload en_US.lang as the reference is recommended.
    
    5.Once a language file gets its appropiate place to be merged, file should be deleted from this repo, unless it is work as backup

At the same time, here provides support of discussing and editing localization file. If you need to do so, remember:

    1.Accurate, it is NECESSARY
    
    2.Readable, or in another word, "understandable"
    
    3.Beautiful, if possible

# About permission
